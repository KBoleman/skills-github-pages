Hello, my name is Timothy Coleman, and I'm a UCLA undergrad working towards becoming a Solutions Architect. In completing and documenting these cloud projects, I aim to build cloud-engineering and architectural skills, improve my understanding of cloud principles and GitHub, and demonstrate commitment, learning, and growth.

The goal of this project is to learn how to use QuickSight to connect to data, build visuals, create calculations, design interactivity, leverage ML, and share dashboards.
