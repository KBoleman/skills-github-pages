Cost: ~ $0.44 per hour


Hello, my name is Timothy Coleman and I'm a UCLA undergrad working towards becoming a Solutions Architect. This is first of a series of cloud projects that I will document on GitHub. In making these posts, I aim to build cloud-engineering and architectural skills, improve my understanding of cloud principles and GitHub, and demonstrate commitment, learning, and growth.


The goal of this project is to develop a simple web application infrastructure

The following services / resouese are utilized:
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Security Groups (SGs)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- AWS Systems Manager (SSM
- Application Load Balancer
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Autoscaling Groups (ASGs)

## Setup Networking
First things first, what even is networking? Truthfully, I do not know confidently. Based on what I do know, I presume that networking refers to the way that computers connect and share data.

AWS Definition of Computer Networking: "Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other." I was pretty close.

My goal here is to use the VPC wizard to create a virtual network for my web server, including subnets, routing, and more

Quick Notes:
- Virtual Networks provide secure, isolated environments for AWS resources to be launced and shared
Subnets
